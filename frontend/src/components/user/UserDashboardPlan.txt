Here is the comprehensive plan for updating the CSS and JavaScript files for the user dashboard to improve responsiveness and layout:

### Plan:

1. **UserDashboard.css**
   - **Enhance Mobile Responsiveness**:
     - Ensure that the sidebar collapses properly on mobile devices and does not interfere with the main content.
     - Adjust padding and margins for the main content area to ensure it fits well on smaller screens.
     - Modify the grid layout for the stats and user info cards to stack vertically on mobile devices.
   - **Improve Flexibility**:
     - Use relative units (like percentages) for widths instead of fixed pixel values where applicable to allow for better scaling.
     - Ensure that all elements have appropriate `max-width` settings to prevent overflow on smaller screens.

2. **UserDashboard.js**
   - **Toggle Sidebar Functionality**:
     - Ensure that the sidebar toggle functionality works seamlessly across all devices.
     - Implement any necessary state management to handle the sidebar's open/closed state effectively.
   - **Dynamic Class Application**:
     - Apply classes conditionally based on the sidebar's state to ensure the layout adjusts correctly when the sidebar is opened or closed.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Test the dashboard on various screen sizes to ensure that all elements are displayed correctly and that the layout is responsive.
- Gather user feedback on the new layout and make adjustments as necessary.
